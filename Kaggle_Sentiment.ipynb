       " 'the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year e g the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important bases like being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to h g wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings',\n",
